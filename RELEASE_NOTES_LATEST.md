## New Features
- **Implement date/time and string binary operators**
  
  We implement addition and subtraction operators for `date`, `datetime`, `datetime_tz`, and `duration`.
  
  We also implement string concatenation, also performedd with the `+` operator.
  
  
- **Implement built-in functions length(), iid(), and label()**
  
  - `len()`: string length in codepoints / unicode scalar values (USVs): `len("TypeDB") == 6`, `len("こんにちは") == 5`, `len("⭐") == 1`, `len("❤️‍🔥") == 4`;
  - `iid()`: an instance's internal ID as a string, to be used in an `iid` constraint in following queries;
  - `label()`: a type's label as a string, for convenience in fetch queries.
  
  

## Bugs Fixed
- **Always regenerate indices for modified relations on schema commit**
  #7594  changed relation-index behaviour so schema transactions avoid reading or writing to relation-indices - and generate indices at commit time for newly inserted relations, or relations of types that became eligible for indices as part of schema modifications. 
  
  
- **Fix division error checking so a zero result is not considered an error**
  Division relied on `f64::is_normal`. Now, only `FpCategory::Inf` and `FpCategory::Nan` are considered errors.
  This is checked by `f64::is_finite`
  
- **Fix Sentry crash reporting by updating dependencies**
  Update dependencies https://github.com/typedb/typedb-dependencies/pull/595 to use the `rustls` feature of `sentry`, allowing it to always send reports to the protected sentry endpoint. Fixes https://github.com/typedb/typedb/issues/7650.
  
  The ureq HTTP transport used by Sentry requires a TLS backend to make HTTPS requests to sentry.io. Our sentry dependency was configured with `default-features = false` and the ureq feature, which, following the description on the [official docs page](https://crates.io/crates/sentry/0.36.0), enabled `rustls` by default. If built using Bazel, this indeed works correctly. However, when built through Cargo, no actual reports could be sent to the Sentry endpoint, as `rustls` [is not enabled](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/blob/0.36.0/sentry/Cargo.toml#L81) for `ureq` by default (default features, including `rustls`, are turned off).
  
  
- **Annotations can use losslessy castable arguments**
  
  We fix two panics that arose when using castable values (eg. integers range annotations for decimal value types) in parameters to annotations, such as a `decimal` that used `integer` arguments: `person owns salary @values(10)` or `person owns salary @range(0..1000000);`.
  
  We make consistent the behaviour that:
  
  - Integers are losslessly castable to Decimal and Double value types
  - Date is lossless castable to DateTime
  
  We have also updated BDD tests to reflect that doubles are no longer losslessly castable to decimals, since they have different precision.
