/// Manages background tasks that should finish gracefully on shutdown.
///
/// # Design
/// - A cloneable [`TokioTaskSpawner`] is handed to lower-level components to spawn tasks.
/// - The tracker listens to a global `watch::Receiver<()>` shutdown signal.
/// - When shutdown is observed, the tracker:
///   1. `close()`s to stop accepting new tasks;
///   2. `wait()`s until all tracked tasks finish.
///
/// # Guarantees
/// - Tasks spawned through the spawner are kept alive by the Tokio runtime as usual.
/// - **To guarantee** that long-running tasks (e.g., intervals) complete their final
///   work on shutdown (like “act_on_shutdown”), the owner **must call** [`TokioTaskTracker::join`]
///   before letting the runtime drop.
///
/// This avoids blocking in `Drop` (which can deadlock a Tokio worker) while still
/// giving you a single place to wait for all background work to finish.
/// For more information, see https://tokio.rs/tokio/topics/shutdown.
