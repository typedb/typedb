# Titan configuration sample: Cassandra over a socket

# This file connects to a Cassandra daemon running on localhost via
# Thrift.  Cassandra must already be started before starting Titan
# with this file.

# The primary persistence provider used by Titan.  This is required.  It
# should be set one of Titan's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift, cassandra,
# astyanax, embeddedcassandra, hbase, inmemory) or to the full package and
# classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend=cassandrathrift

# The hostname or comma-separated list of hostnames of storage backend
# servers.  This is only applicable to some storage backends, such as
# cassandra and hbase.

# Whether to enable Titan's database-level cache, which is shared across
# all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by holding
# hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood of
# reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to
# independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing
# them.

# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: MASKABLE

# How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after

# backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily
# making them immediately visible.

# entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set
# to 0).
