pub(crate) fn apply_optimisations(program: &mut Program) {

    // apply optimisation passes through the program

    // 1. apply role player indexing

    // last: eliminate redundant constraints (eg. $x type person, $x isa $_generated -- both covered by type inference and embeddable as a filter into an IR).

    // Ideas:
    // - we should move subtrees/graphs of a query that have no returned variables into a new pattern: "Check", which are only checked for a single answer
    // - we should push constraints, like comparisons, that apply to variables passed into functions, into the function itself
    // - function inlining v1: if a function does not have recursion or sort/offset/limit, we could inline the function into the query
    // - function inlining v2: we could try to inline/lift some constraints from recursive calls into the parent query to dramatically cut the search space
    // - function inlining v3: we could introduce new sub-patterns that include sort/offset/limit that let us more generally inline functions?
