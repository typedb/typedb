## Calling functions directly from driver

Allow calling functions directly from driver with supplied input arguments.

## Templated write pipelines

Allow schema-defined function to contain write stages. Allow calling this functions directly from driver/console, but not from within patterns.

## ORM for structs

Language-native struct codegen for TypeDB-native structs, and easy mapping in driver between the two. (In particular as function inputs)

## Fetch for different types

Allow fetch to return different types, including native structs.
