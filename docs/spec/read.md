# Pattern matching language

This section first describes the pattern matching language of TypeDB, which relies on _variables_.

## Basics: Patterns, variables, concept rows, satisfaction

### (Theory) Statements and pattern

* **statements:** syntactic units of TypeQL (see Glossary)
* **patterns:** collection of statements, combined with logical connectives.

### (Feature) Pattern operations

#### **Case AND_PATT**

* ðŸ”· _Conjunction_ `<PATT1> <PATT2>`
  > We match "`<PATT1>` **and** `<PATT2>`"

    * _Note:_ Any `<PATT>` is terminated with a `;`

#### **Case OR_PATT**

* ðŸ”· _Disjunction_ `{ <PATT1> } or { <PATT2> };`
  > We **either** match `<PATT1>` or `<PATT2>`

  _Note_ This extends to $k$ patterns chained with interleaving `or`.

#### **Case NOT_PATT**

* ðŸ”· _Negation_. `not { <PATT> };`
  > We ensure `<PATT>` has **no match**.

  _Note_ `<PATT>` may have **quantified variables**

#### **Case TRY_PATT**

* ðŸ”· _Optional pattern_ `try { PATT };`
  > We **optionally** match `PATT` whenever possible

_Terminology_ What's inside `<OP> { ... }` is called a **`<OP>`-block**.


### (Theory) Pattern branches

A **disjunctive normal (DNF) of a pattern `<PATT>`** is a pattern obtained by recursively applying transformations of the form
```
<PATT1> { <PATT2> } or {<PATT3> };
--transforms to-->
{ <PATT1> <PATT2> } or { <PATT1> <PATT3> };
```
The resulting DNF of `<PATT>` will itself be a pattern of the form:
```
{ <BRANCH1> } or { <BRANCH2> } or ... ;
```

**Important**. The patterns `<BRANCHi>` are _unique_ up to re-ordering them. We call them the **branches** of `<PATT>`.

_Note_. The transformation also applies _inside_ `not` and `try` blocks.


### (Theory) Variables and bindings

Variables appear in statements. They fall in different categories, which can be recognized as follows.

* **Syntax**: variables in patterns `PATT` are `$`-prefixed labels
    * _Examples_: `$x`, `$y`, `$person`

#### **Variable categories**

* **Categories** indicate what type of concept a variable can hold. In a pattern `PATT`, any variable will belong to one of four _categories_ based on the following rules.

    * **Type variables** (**tvar**, uppercase convention in this spec)
        * Any variable used in a type position in a statement

    * **Value variables** (**vvar**, lowercase convention in this spec)
        * Any variable assigned (with `=`) to the output of an non-list expression
        * Any variable assigned (with `=` or `in`) to the output of a function in a position with value output type is a value variable

    * **List variables** (**lvar**, lowercase convention in this spec)
        * Any variable assigned (with `=`) to a list expression.
        * Any variable typed with a list type (e.g., `... has name[] $l`)

    * **Instance variables** (**ivar**, lowercase convention in this spec)
        * Any remaining variable must be an instance var.

... the last three together comprise _element vars_ (**evars**). Evars are those variables that can be in the signature and return statement of a function.

_Remark 1_. The code variable `$x` will be written as $`x`$ in math notation (without $`\$`$).

#### **Bound variables and valid patterns**

* **Bounds** ensure variables are tied to database concepts. (**#BDD**)

    * A variable is **bound** if it appears in a _bound position_ of at least one statement.
        * _Note_. Most statements bind their variables: this is why we will mainly highlight _non-bound positions_

    * A pattern `PATT` is **valid** if ***all variables are bound***.
        * _(Fun fact: otherwise, we may have to solve provably unsolvable problems)_

_Going forward, we always work with valid patterns_

#### **Variable modes and unambiguous patterns**

* **Modes of variables** indicate how to compute answers for variables. In a valid pattern `PATT`, a variable appear in various _modes_ based on the following rules.

    * **Retrievable variables** are variables that are bound in _some_ statement that is _not_ `not`-gated (i.e. it is not enclosed in a not `not` block).

    * **Negation-bound variables** are variables that are bound _only_ in statements that are `not`-gated (i.e. they are enclosed in a parent `not` block).

    * **Optional variables** are variables that are
        * retrievable
        * are bound only in `try`-gated statements

* **Principles of unambiguity**. A valid pattern is **unambiguous** if it satifies the following.

    * _No [alpha-conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#%CE%B1-conversion) needed!_ No negation-bound or optional variable appears bound in **sibling blocks** in the **same branch** (see "DNF") of the pattern without also being bound in a joint parent block.
        * _Note_ This applies to `?`-marked variables, as these unpack into `try` as outlined in **IN_FUN_PATT** and **LET_FUN_PATT**

    * _No negated try's_ We dissallow `try`'s which are `not`-gated (i.e. cannot `try` inside a `not`).

#### **Anonymous variables**

* _Anon vars_: anon vars start with `$_`. They behave like normal variables, but leave the variables name implicit and are automatically discarded and results of the pattern they appear in are deduplicated. In other words:
```
[input]               // incoming stream with variables $a, $b, $c
match <PATT>          // binds $x, $y, $z, $_1
```
is equivalent to
```
for each (a,b,c) in [input] {
  match [set $a=a, $b=b, $c=c, $_1=$var1 in <PATT>]
  deselect $var1;     // equivalent to "select $x, $y, $z"
  distinct;           // deduplicate new results
  return { $a=a, $b=b, $c=c, $x, $y, $z };  // incorporate in parent stream
}
```
(note that this is very much pseudo code, not actual TypeQL)

* _Remark_: Anon vars can be both **tvar**s and **evar**s


### (Theory) Typed concept rows

* _Concepts_. A **concept** is a type or an element in a type.
* _Typed concept rows_. An **typed concept row** (abbreviated 'crow') is a mapping of named variables (the **column names**) to _unapplied_ typed concepts (the **row entries**). A crow `r` may be written as:
  ```
  r = ($x->a:T, $y->b:S, ...)
  ```
  In math. notation $m$ can be written as: $`(x \mapsto a:T, y \mapsto b:S, ...)`$).

  To emphasize: By definition, types in crows are **unapplied** (see "Applying dependencies")
  > In other words, the definition dissallows using types with applied dependencies like `$x -> a : T($y : I)`. Instead, we only allow `$x -> a:T` for bare symbols "T". (This is because we don't expose dependencies as such to the user)

    * _Assigned concepts_. Write `r($x)` (math. notation $`r(x)`$) for the concept that `r` assigns to `$x`.
    * _Assigned types_. Write `T($x)` (math. notation $`T_r(x)`$) for the type that `r` assigns to `$x`.
        * _Special case: assigned kinds_. Note that `T($x)` may be `Ent`, `Rel`, `Att`, `Trait` (`Rol`), or `Val` (for value types) when `$x` is assigned a type as a concept â€” we speak of `T($x)` as the **type kind** of `r($x)` in this case.


### Input crows for patterns

An **input crow** `r` for a pattern `PATT` is

* a crow,
* with subset of its variables marked as **input**,

<!-- Examples for the typing algorithm:
fun a($x: person) -> name[]:
match
  $x has firstname $f;
  $x has lastname $l;
  $namelist = [$f, $l]; // type as `[$f] + [$l]`
return $namelist;

match
  $x has color $y;
  $x has name $y; // "violet"
  $y isa color;

// 2x2 matrix:
// no:
$y isa name;
$y isa color;
// no:
$x has name $y;
$y isa color;
// no:
$y isa name;
$x has color $y;
// yes:
$x has name $y;
$x has color $y;
// STICKY: are we happy with this?
-->

## Pattern semantics

### Satisfaction and answers

* Given an input crow `r` for `PATT` ***satisfies*** `PATT` if

    * **Type satisfaction**. the typing assignemt of `r` satisfies the typing condition below.
    * **Pattern semantics**. the concept assignment of `r` satisfis the pattern conditions below.

  > Intuitively, this means substituting the variables in `PATT` with the concepts assigned in `r` yields statements that are true in our type system.

* A crow `r` is an **answer** to a pattern `PATT` if the following are satisfied:

    * **Retrievable domain**. Each non-input variable in `r` must be a retrievable variable of `PATT`
    * **Satisfaction**. `r` must satisfy the pattern (as outlined in next sections)
    * **Minimality**. No subset of `r` with the same input-marked variables satisfies the `PATT`

      > In other words, `r` is a _minimal extension_ of the given input.

_Example_: Consider the pattern `$x isa Person;` (i.e. a pattern comprising a single statement). The crow `($x -> p)` satisfies the pattern if `p` is an element of the type `Person`. The crow `($x -> p, $y -> p)` also satisfies the pattern, but it is not minimal... unless `$y` was marked as an input, in which case it _does_ satisfy the pattern.

### Typing satisfaction

* For tvars `$X` in `PATT`, `T($X)` is a type kind (`entity`, `attribute`, `relation`, `trait`, `value`)
* For vvars `$x` in `PATT`, `T($x)` is a value type (primitive or struct)
* For lvars `$x` in `PATT`, `T($x)` is a list type `A[]` for ***minimal*** `A` a type such that `A` is the minimal upper bounds of the types of the list elements `<EL>` in the list `r($x) = [<EL>, <EL>, ...]` (note: our type system does have minimal upper bounds thanks to sums)
* For ivars `$x` in `PATT`, `T($x)` is a schema type `A` such that $`r(x) :_! A`$ isa **direct typing**

### Pattern satisfaction

#### Block-level bindings

Given a (valid and unambiguous) pattern `PATT` in DNF, we define for subpatterns

* `not { SUBPATT };`
* `try { SUBPATT };`

a variable `$x` in `SUBPATT` is **block-level** if its bound in statements that appears unnested in a branch of `SUBPATT` but not a parent block.

#### Recursive definition

We define satisfication of a pattern `PATT` in DNF by an input crow `r`. The definition recursively destructures the pattern into subpatterns `P` (to begin, set `P = PATT`).

* If `P = STMT; SUBPATT` then `r` satisfies `P` if:
    * The statement **<STMT>** is satisfied by `r` as outlined in the _next sections_.
    * `r` satisfies `SUBPATT`;

* If `P = { SUBPATT_1 } or { SUBPATT_2 } or ... ;` then `r` satisfies `P` if:
    * `r` satisfies `SUBPATT_i` for any `i`

* If `P = not { SUBPATT };` then `r` satisfies `P` if:
    * `r` does _not contain any_ block-level bound variables of the block _except_ input vars
    * `r` cannot be completed with entries for block-level bound variable to satisfy `SUBPATT`

* If `P = try { SUBPATT };` then `r` satisfies `P` if:
    * `r` _contains all_ block-level bound variables of the block
    * and:
        * either: `r` satisfies `SUBPATT`
        * or:
            * all block-level bound variables are assigned $`\emptyset`$ (i.e. empty concept) by `r` _except_ input vars
            * after obtain `r'` from `r` by removing block-level bound, non-input variables, `r'` cannot be completed with entries for block-level bound variable to satisfy `SUBPATT`

### `Let` declarations in patterns

_System property_

The keyword `let` has two special properties:

* ðŸ”¶ `let` assignments must be acyclic
* ðŸ”¶ No variable can be `let` assigned twice

## Satisfaction semantics of...

We discuss the satisfaction semantics of various classes of statements.

_Math. notation (Replacing **var**s with concepts)_. When discussing pattern semantics, we always consider **fully variablized** statements (e.g. `$x isa $X`, `$X sub $Y`). This also determines satisfaction of **partially assigned** versions of these statements (e.g. `$x isa A`, `$X sub A`, `A sub $Y`, or `x isa $A`).

## ... Function statements

### **Case LET_FUN_PATT**

_Remark_ the following can be said in less space, but we chose the more principled longer route, via "single returns".

* ðŸ”¶ `let _, ..., _, $x, _, ..., _ = f($a, $b, ...)` (where `$x` is in $i$th position of the comma-separated list of length $n$, and all other positions are "blanks" `_`). This statement is satisfied if:
    * denoting *function evalution* (see "Function evaluation") with inputs from the crow `r` by $`ev(f(r(a), r(b), ...)`$,
    * $`\mathsf{ev}(f(r(a), r(b), ...)`$ contains exactly one row $`w`$ of length $n$ (if it contains no row we reject)
    * $`r(x)`$ is the $i$th entry of $`w`$ (corresponding to `$x` being used in $`i`$th position on the LHS)

  _Note_. This is equivalent to `$x in F_i($a, $b, ...)` where `F_i` modifies `F` with an additional selection of the `i`th variable.

* ðŸ”¶ `let $x, $y?, ..., $w = f($a, $b, ...)` is satisfied if the following pattern is satisfied:
    ```
    let $x,_,...,_ in F($a, $b, ...);               // first var (non-optional!)
    try { let _, $y, ...,_ in F($a, $b, ...); };    // second var (optional!)
    ...                                             // ...
    let _, _, ...,$w in F($a, $b, ...);             // last var
    ```

  _Note_. `?`-marked variables are retrieved with **separate** `try`-blocks.

* ðŸ”¶ `let $x, $y?, ..., $w = F($a, <EXPR_b>, ...)>` is satisfied if the following pattern is satisfied:
    ```
    let $_b = <EXPR_b>;
    ...
    let $x, $y?, ..., $w in F($a, $_b, ...)
    ```

_System property_

* ðŸ”¶ _Output type_ Function call must be to a **single-return** function, i.e. have output type `T, ...`.
* ðŸ”¶ _Boundedness_ All variable arguments (or variables in expression arguments) to `f` must be set in the crow `r` (i.e. should be bound somewhere else in the pattern).
* ðŸ”¶ _Acyclicity (pattern-level constraint)_ All let statements must be acyclic, e.g. we **cannot have**
    ```
    let $x = f($y); 
    let $y = f($x);
    ```

### **Case LET_IN_FUN_PATT**

* ðŸ”¶ `let $x, $y?, ..., $w in F($a, <EXPR_b>, ...)>` is satisfied if, for some choice of row $`w \in \mathsf{ev}(F(r(a),v_r(expr_b),...)`$ in the evaluation set of the function call such that the following pattern is satisfied:
    ```
    let $x, $y?, ..., $w = f($a, <EXPR_b>, ...)
    ```

  where `f($a, <EXPR_b>, ...)` denotes a single-return function call ***defined*** to evaluate to row `w`.

_System property_

* ðŸ”¶ _Output type_ Function call must be to a **stream-return** function, i.e. have output type `{ T, ... }`.
* ðŸ”¶ _Boundedness_ All variable arguments (or variables in expression arguments) to `F` must be set in the crow `r` (i.e. should be bound somewhere else in the pattern).
* ðŸ”¶ _Acyclicity (pattern-level constraint)_ All let statements must be acyclic, e.g. we **cannot have**
    ```
    let $x in F($y); 
    let $y in F($x);
    ```

## ... Type statements

### **Case TYPE_DEF_PATT**
* âž– `Kind $A` (for `Kind` in `{entity, relation, attribute}`) is satisfied if $`r(A) : \mathbf{Kind}`$

* âž– `(Kind) $A sub $B` is satisfied if $`r(A) : \mathbf{Kind}`$, $`r(B) : \mathbf{Kind}`$, $`r(A) \lneq r(B)`$
* âž–  `(Kind) $A sub! $B` is satisfied if $`r(A) : \mathbf{Kind}`$, $`r(B) : \mathbf{Kind}`$, $`r(A) <_! r(B)`$

_Remark_: `sub!` is convenient, but could actually be expressed with `sub`, `not`, and `is`. Similar remarks apply to **all** other `!`-variations of TypeQL key words below.

### **Case REL_PATT**
* âž– `$A relates $I` is satisfied
    * either if $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I))`$
    * or if $`\diamond(r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I)))`$

* âž– `$A relates $I as $J` is satisfied if
    * $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I))`$ or $`\diamond(r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I)))`$
    * there exists $`B : \mathbf{Rel}(r(J))`$ or $`\diamond(B : \mathbf{Rel}(r(J)))`$
    * $`A \leq B`$ and $`r(I) \leq r(J)`$.

* ðŸ”¶ `$A relates $I[]` is satisfied if $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r([I]))`$ and
    * either if $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}([r(I)])`$
    * or if $`\diamond(r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}([r(I)]))`$

* ðŸ”¶ `$A relates $I[] as $J[]` is satisfied if
    * $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r([I]))`$ or $`\diamond(r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r([I]))`$
    * there exists $`B : \mathbf{Rel}(r([J]))`$ or $`\diamond(B : \mathbf{Rel}(r([J])))`$
    * $`A \leq B`$ and $`r(I) \leq r(J)`$.

### **Case DIRECT_REL_PATT**

* ðŸ”® `$A relates! $I` is satisfied if
    * $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I))`$ and **not** $`r(A) \lneq B : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I))`$
    * or if $`\diamond(r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I)))`$ and **not** $`\diamond(r(A) \lneq B : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I)))`$

* ðŸ”® `$A relates(!) $I as! $J` is satisfied if `$A relates(!) $I` and
    * there exists $`B : \mathbf{Rel}(r(J))`$ or $`\diamond(B : \mathbf{Rel}(r(J)))`$
    * $`A <_! B`$ and $`r(I) <_! r(J)`$

* ðŸ”® `$A relates! $I[]` is satisfied if
    * $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r([I]))`$ and **not** $`r(A) \lneq r(B) : \mathbf{Rel}(r([I]))`$
    * or if $`\diamond(r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r([I])))`$ and **not** $`\diamond(r(A) \lneq r(B) : \mathbf{Rel}(r([I])))`$

* ðŸ”® `$A relates $I[] as! $J[]` is satisfied if `$A relates(!) $I[]` and
    * there exists $`B : \mathbf{Rel}(r([J]))`$ or $`\diamond(B : \mathbf{Rel}(r([J])))`$
    * $`A <_! B`$ and $`r(I) <_! r(J)`$

### **Case PLAYS_PATT**

* âž– `$A plays $I` is satisfied if
    * either $`r(A) \leq A'`$ and $`A' <_! r(I)`$
    * or if $`r(A) \leq A'`$ and $`\diamond(A' <_! r(I))`$

### **Case DIRECT_PLAYS_PATT**

* ðŸ”® `$A plays! $I` is satisfied if $`r(A) <_! r(I)`$
    * $`A <_! r(I)`$
    * _(to match `@abstract` for `plays!` must use annotation, see **PLAYS_ABSTRACT_PATT**)_

### **Case VALUE_PATT**

* âž– `$A value $V` is satisfied if $`r(A) \leq A'$ and $\mathrm{val} : A' \to r(V)$

### **Case OWNS_PATT**

* âž– `$A owns $B` is satisfied if
    * either $`r(A) \leq A'`$ and $`A' <_! O_{r(B)})`$
    * or $`r(A) \leq A'`$ and $`\diamond(A' <_! O_{r(B)})`$

* ðŸ”¶ `$A owns $B[]` is satisfied if $`r(A) \leq A' <_! r(O_B)`$ (for $`A'`$ **not** an trait type)
    * either $`r(A) \leq A'`$ and $`A' <_! r(O_{B[]})`$
    * or $`r(A) \leq A'`$ and $`\diamond(A' <_! r(O_{B[]}))`$

_Remark_. In particular, if `A owns B[]` has been declared, then `$X owns B` will match the answer `r($X) = A`.

### **Case DIRECT_OWNS_PATT**

* ðŸ”® `$A owns! $B` is satisfied if
    * $`r(A) <_! r(O_B)`$
    * or $`\diamond(r(A) <_! r(O_B))`$

* ðŸ”® `$A owns! $B[]` is satisfied if $`r(A) <_! r(O_B)`$
    * $`r(A) <_! r(O_B)`$
    * or if $`\diamond(r(A) <_! r(O_B))`$

### **Cases TYP_IS_PATT and LABEL_PATT**
* ðŸ”· `$A is $B` is satisfied if $`r(A) = r(B)`$ (this is actually covered by the later case `IS_PATT`)
* ðŸ”· `$A label <LABEL>` is satisfied if $`r(A)`$ has **primary label or alias** `<LABEL>`

## ... Type constraint statements

### Cardinality

_To discuss: the usefulness of constraint patterns seems overall low, could think of a different way to retrieve full schema or at least annotations (this would be more useful than, say,having to find cardinalities by "trialing and erroring" through matching)._

#### **Case CARD_PATT**
* âž– cannot match `@card(n..m)` (STICKY: there's just not much point to do so ... rather have normalized schema dump. discuss `@card($n..$m)`??)
<!-- 
* `A relates I @card(n..m)` is satisfied if $`r(A) : \mathbf{Rel}(r(I))`$ and schema allows $`|a|_I`$ to be any number in range `n..m`.
* `A plays B:I @card(n..m)` is satisfied if ...
* `A owns B @card(n...m)` is satisfied if ...
* `$A relates $I[] @card(n..m)` is satisfied if ...
* `$A owns $B[] @card(n...m)` is satisfied if ...

_Remark_: In the `is` pattern we cannot syntactically distinguish whether we are in the "type" or "element" case (it's the only such pattern where tvars and evars can be in the same position!) but this is alleviated by the pattern being non-binding, i.e. we require further statements which bind these variables, which then determines them to be tvars are evars.

_Remarks_

* Careful: the generic case `<T>` modify earlier parts of the
* `T`-functions (`T_FUN`) are function calls to *single-return* functions with non-tupled output type `T` or `T?`

_Explicit casts_. ðŸ”® Introduce explicit castings between types to our grammar. For example:
* `long(1.0) == 1`
* `double(10) / double(3) == 3.3333`)

### Expression evaluation

Given a crow `r` that assign all vars in an `<EXPR>` we define
* value evaluation `vev@r(<EXPR>)` (math. notation $`v_r(expr)`$)
* type evaluation `Tev@r(<EXPR>)` (math. notation $`T_r(expr)`$)]

as follows. First note that we can unambiguously distinguish **value** from **list** expressions in our grammar. We evaluate each of those as follows.

#### Value expressions

* ðŸ”¶ The _value expressions_ `VAL_EXPR` is evaluated as follows:
    * **Substitute** all vars `$x` by `r($x)`
    * If `r($x)` isa attribute instance, **replace** by `val(r($x))`
    * $`v_r(expr)`$ is the result of evaluating all operations with their **usual semantics**
        * `1 + 1 == 2`
        * `10 / 3 == 3` (integer division satisfies `p/q + p%q = p`)
    * $`T_r(expr)`$ is the **unique type** of the substituted expression, noting:
        * We allow **implicit casts** of `long -> dec -> double`.
        * This is always unique except possibly for the `STRUCT` case (see property below)!

_System property_.

* ðŸ”¶ If $`T_r(expr)`$ is non-unique for a `STRUCT` expression (which may be the case because, `STRUCT` may share fields) we require the expression to have a `HINT`, or otherwise throw an error (***see Grammar above***, case `STRUCT`).

_Remark_. Struct values are semantically considered up to reordering their components.

#### List expressions

* ðŸ”¶ The _list expressions_ `LIST_EXPR` is evaluated as follows:
    * Substitute all vars `$x` by `r($x)`
    * (**Do not replace** attributes!)
    * $`v_r(expr)`$ is the result of concatenation and sublist operations with their **usual semantics**
        * e.g. `[a] + [a,b,c][1..2] = [a,b,c]` (`[1..2]` includes indices `[1,2]`)
        * or `([a] + [a,b,c])[1..2] = [a,b]`
    * $`T_r(expr)`$ is the **minimal type** of all the list elements (usually some sum type)

**Note**: While the type checker cannot statically determine $`T_r(expr)`$, it can statically construct an upper bound of that type.

### (Feature) Boundedness of variables in expressions

1. ðŸ”¶ Generally, variables in expressions `<EXPR>` are **never bound**, except ...
    * ðŸ”¶ the exception are **single-variable list indices**, i.e. `$list[$index]`; in this case `$index` is bound. (This makes sense, since `$list` must be bound elsewhere, and then `$index` is bound to range over the length of the list) (**#BDD**)
3. ðŸ”¶ Struct components are considered to be unordered: i.e., `{ x: $x, y: $y}` is equal to `{ y: $y, x: $x }`.

_Remark_: The exception for list indices is mainly for convenience. Indeed, you could always explicitly bind `$index` with the pattern `$index in [0..len($list)-1];`. See "Case **LET_IN_LIST_PATT**" below.

### Simple expression patterns

#### **Case LET_PATT**
* ðŸ”· `let $x = <EXPR>` is satisfied if **both**
    * `r($x)` equals $`v_r(expr)`$
    * `T($x)` equals $`T_r(expr)`$

_System property_

1. _Assignments bind_. The left-hand variable is bound by the pattern.
2. _Assign once, to vars only_. Any variable can be assigned only once within a patternâ€”importantly, the left hand side _must be_ a variable (replacing it with a concept will throw an error; this implicitly applies to "Match semantics").
3. _Acyclicity (pattern-level constraint)_. All let statements must be acyclic, i.e. the graph of variables with directed edges from RHS vars to LHS vars in let statements is acyclic (e.g. we cannot have `$x = $x + $y; $y = $y - $x;`)

#### **Case LET_DESTRUCT_PATT**
* ðŸ”¶ `let <DESTRUCT> = <STRUCT>` is satisfied if, after substituting concepts from `r`, the left hand side (up to potentially omitting components whose variables are marked as optional) matched the structure of the right and side, and each variable on the left matches the evaluated expression of the correponding position on the right.

_System property_

1. ðŸ”¶ _Assignments bind_. The left-hand variable is bound by the pattern.
2. _Acyclicity (pattern-level constraint)_. All let statements must be acyclic, i.e. the graph of variables with directed edges from RHS vars to LHS vars in let statements is acyclic.

#### **Case EQ_PATT**
* âž– `<EXPR1> == <EXPR2>` is satisfied if $`v_r(expr_1) = v_r(expr_2)`$
* âž– `<EXPR1> != <EXPR2>` is equivalent to `not { <EXPR1> != <EXPR2> }` (see "Patterns")

_System property_

1. All variables are bound **not bound**.

#### **Case COMP_PATT**

The following are all kind of obvious (for `<COMP>` one of `<`,`<=`,`>`,`>=`):

* âž– `<INT> <COMP> <INT>`
* âž– `<BOOl> <COMP> <BOOL>` (`false`<`true`)
* âž– `<STRING> <COMP> <STRING>` (lexicographic comparison)
* âž– `<DATETIME> <COMP> <DATETIME>` (usual datetime order)
* âž– `<TIME> <COMP> <TIME>` (usual time order)
* âž– `<STRING> contains <STRING>`
* ðŸ”· `<STRING> like <REGEX>` (where `<REGEX>` is a regex string without variables)

_System property_

1. In all the above patterns all variables are **not bound**.

### List expression patterns

### **Case LET_IN_LIST_PATT**
* ðŸ”· `let $x in $l` is satisfied if $`r(x) \in r(l)`$
* ðŸ”¶ `let $x in <LIST_EXPR>` is equivalent to `$l = <LIST_EXPR>; $x in $l` (see "Syntactic Sugar")

_System property_

1. The right-hand side variable(s) of the pattern are **not bound**. (The left-hand side variable is bound.)
1. _Acyclicity (pattern-level constraint)_.  All let statements must be acyclic, i.e. the graph of variables with directed edges from RHS vars to LHS vars in let statements is acyclic.

### **Case LIST_CONTAINS_PATT**
* ðŸ”¶ `$l contains $x` is satisfied if $`r(x) \in r(l)`$
* ðŸ”¶ `<LIST_EXPR contains $x` is equivalent to `$l = <LIST_EXPR>; $l contains $x` (see "Syntactic Sugar")

_System property_

1. _Boundedness_ no side of the patterns is binding (this is in effect a comparator).


# Data manipulation language

## Match semantics

* _Syntax_ The `match` clause has syntax
    ```
    match <PATTERN>
    ```

* _Input crows_: The clause can take as input a stream `{ r }` of concept rows `r`.

* _Output crows_: For each `r`:
    * replace all patterns in `PATT` with concepts from `r`.
    * Compute the **set** of answers `{ r' }`.
    * The final output stream will be `{ (r,r') }`.


## Function semantics

### Function signature

#### **Case SIGNATURE_STREAM_FUN**

* ðŸ”¶ Stream-return function signature syntax:
  _Syntax_:
    ```
    fun F ($x: A, $y: B[]) -> { C, D[], E? } :
    ```
  where
    * types `A, B, C, D, E` can be available entity, relation, attribute, value types (both structure and primitive).

_Remark: see GH issue on trais (Could have `A | B | plays C` input types)._

_Terminology_ If the function returns a single types (`{ C }`) then we call it a **singleton** function.

#### **Case SIGNATURE_SINGLE_FUN**

* ðŸ”¶ Single-return function signature syntax:
    ```
    fun F ($x: A, $y: B[]) -> C, D[], E? :
    ```
  where
    * types `A, B, C, D, E` can be available entity, relation, attribute, value types (both structure and primitive).

_STICKY: allow types to be optional in args (this extends types to sum types, trait types, etc.)_

_Terminology_ If the function returns a single types (`C`) then we call it a **singleton** function.

### Function body

#### **Case READ_PIPELINE_FUN**

* ðŸ”¶ Function body syntax:
  _Syntax_:
    ```
    <READ_PIPELINE>
    ```

_System property_

* ðŸ”¶ _Read only_. Pipeline must be read-only, i.e. cannot use write clauses (`insert`, `delete`, `update`, `put`)
* ðŸ”¶ _Require crow stream output_ Pipeline must be non-terminal (e.g. cannot end in `fetch`).

### Function return

#### **Case RETURN_STREAM_FUN**

The return clause corresponds to its output type signature.

* ðŸ”¶ When function output type is `{ A, B, ... }` then return clause of the form:
    ```
    return { $a, $b, ... };
    ```

_System property_

* ðŸ”¶ _Require bindings_ all vars (`$x`, `$y`, ...) must be bound in the pipeline (taken into account any variable selections through `select` and `reduce` operators).

#### **Case RETURN_SINGLE_FUN**

* ðŸ”¶ When function output type is `A, B?, ... ` then return clause of the form:
  _Syntax_:
    ```
    return <SINGLE> $x, $y, ...;
    ```
  where `<SINGLE>` can be:
    * `first`
    * `last`
    * `random`

_System property_.

* ðŸ”¶ `?` on output types correspond exactly to those variables in the return clause that are optional in the function body.
* ðŸ”¶ _Require bindings_ all vars (`$x`, `$y`, ...) must be bound in the read pipeline of the function body (taken into account any variable selections through `select` and `reduce` operators).

#### **Case RETURN_AGG_SINGLE_FUN**

* ðŸ”¶ When function output type is `A?, B?, ... ` then return clause of the form:
    ```
    return <AGG>, <AGG>, ...;
    ```
  is short-hand for:
    ```
    reduce $_1? = <AGG>, $_2? = <AGG>, ... ;
    return first $_1, $_2, ... ;
    ```

_Remark_
Note the optionality `?`, which ensures that the reduce step will not yield an empty crow stream.

### (Theory) Function semantics

***Typing***

* `?` marks variables in the row that can be optional
    * this applies both to output types: `{ A?, B }` and `A?, B`
    * and it applies to variables assignments: `$x?, $y in ...` and `$x?, $y = ...`
* **single-row returning** functions return 0 or 1 rows
* **multi-row returning** ("stream-returning") functions return 0 or more rows.

***Matching***

* single row assignment `$x, $y = ...`  fails if no row is assigned
* single row assignment `$x?, $y = ...`  succeeds if a row is assigned, even if it may be missing the optional variables
* multi row assignment `$x, $y in ...`  fails if no row is assigned
* multi row assignment `$x?, $y in ...`  succeeds if one or more row are assigned, even if they may be missing the optional variables

***Evaluation***

* A function `F` counts as ***evaluated*** on a call `F_CALL` when we completely computed its output stream as follows:
    1. provide input arguments from the call `F_CALL` as a single crow, which is the starting point of the body `READ_PIPELINE`
    2. Then act like an ordinary pipeline, outputting a stream (see "Pipelines")
    3. perform `return` transformation outlined below for final output which is effectively a `select`.
        4. For **single(-row) return** functions we first pick the **first**, **last** or a **random** crow in the stream, making the final output an at-most-single-row output
    4. Denote the output stream by `ev(F_CALL)`
* When negations are use, function in lower strata must be evaluated (on all relevant calls) before function in higher strata (see below)

### (Theory) Order of execution (and recursion)

Since functions can only be called from `match` stages in pipelines, evaluation is deterministic and does not depend on any choices of execution order (i.e. which statements in the pattern we retrieve first), except for **negation**: here, execution order _does_ matter.

* ðŸ”® **Recursion** Functions can be called recursively, as long as negation can be **stratified**:

    * The set of all defined functions is divided into groups called "strata" which are ordered
    * If a function `F` calls a function `G` if must be a in an equal or higher stratum. Moreover, if `G` appears behind an odd number of `not { ... }` in the body of `F`, then `F` must be in a strictly higher stratum.

  _Note_: The semantics in this case is computed "stratum by stratum" from lower strata to higher strata. New facts in our type systems ($`t : T`$) are derived in a bottom-up fashion for each stratum separately.
