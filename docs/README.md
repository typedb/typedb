# README

Blueprints are both meant to:

* **record existing architecture** of TypeDB
* **foresee and outline future architectural** changes

## Disclaimer 

Be wary of typos and logic mistakes (and if you find some, please **report or fix** them!)

## Blueprints

Descriptions of TypeDB's type system, query processing, and evaluation algorithms. The current scope is:

1. **Type system** grammar and rules
2. **TypeQL schema** definition semantics and operation
3. **TypeQL read** query semantics and operation
4. **TypeQL write** query semantics and operation
5. **TypeQL function** syntax
6. **TypeDB query planner** architecture
7. **TypeDB query execution** architecture

## Archived

An old version of the "TypeDB specification".
