/*
The planner should take a Program, and produce a Plan.

A Plan should have an order over the Variables in a Pattern's constraint, for each Functional Block.

We may need to be able to indicate which constraints are 'Seekable (+ ordered)' and therefore can be utilised in an intersection.
For example, function stream outputs are probably not seekable since we won't have traversals be seekable (at least to start!).
